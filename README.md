# Down The Rabbit Hole

#### Jeffrey M. Johnson - Programmer
#### Aidan Nabass- Programmer
#### Steve Tricanowicz - Programmer
#### Tomara Swanson - Artist
#### Olivia Lagase - Artist
#### Chelsea James - Sound Design
#### Harrison - Level Design

### Implementation
Unity3d game engine, C# for code. Rapid prototype so quick and dirty.

### Post Mortem
Donâ€™t go all night!! Sleeping at night and banging through all day is more productive in long run. Should spend a little more time up front in design, as I think this would be more productive overall.
